## Chepy is failing to load due to a config issue. 
Chepy is in constant development, and in future versions, it is quite possible that new options are included for the chepy.conf file. If you are facing an issue with config keys failing to load, delete the `$HOME/.chepy/chepy.conf` file. On next load, Chepy will set a valid working conf file.
